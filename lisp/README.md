A Lisp based on John Shutt's vau calculus. I thought it would be cool
to use a language model to write Lisp programs since macros (fexprs)
might be a good way to use less tokens. Also it's a little difficult
to sandbox Python in Python and I want to do things like control the
amount of effort spent evaluating an expression or restrict access to
effects.
