A resonator is basically a program full of data races with a thread
scheduler trained on a dataset. The idea is that the average behavior
of the threads over time will approximate some implicitly defined
function provided by the loss during training. Each block of the
resonator runs a bunch of trials to try and get an average
measurement, and hopefully the output at the end approximates
something useful.

I wanna try using Llama for all three of the fitness, crossover, and
mutation operations to rewrite a Lisp program.

It's called a resonator because [afaik the principle behind it is
related to stochastic resonance]().
